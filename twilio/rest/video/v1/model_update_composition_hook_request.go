// UpdateCompositionHookRequest struct for UpdateCompositionHookRequest
type UpdateCompositionHookRequest struct {
	// An array of track names from the same group room to merge into the compositions created by the composition hook. Can include zero or more track names. A composition triggered by the composition hook includes all audio sources specified in `audio_sources` except those specified in `audio_sources_excluded`. The track names in this parameter can include an asterisk as a wild card character, which matches zero or more characters in a track name. For example, `student*` includes tracks named `student` as well as `studentTeam`.
	AudioSources []string `json:"AudioSources,omitempty"`
	// An array of track names to exclude. A composition triggered by the composition hook includes all audio sources specified in `audio_sources` except for those specified in `audio_sources_excluded`. The track names in this parameter can include an asterisk as a wild card character, which matches zero or more characters in a track name. For example, `student*` excludes `student` as well as `studentTeam`. This parameter can also be empty.
	AudioSourcesExcluded []string `json:"AudioSourcesExcluded,omitempty"`
	// Whether the composition hook is active. When `true`, the composition hook will be triggered for every completed Group Room in the account. When `false`, the composition hook never triggers.
	Enabled bool `json:"Enabled,omitempty"`
	// The container format of the media files used by the compositions created by the composition hook. Can be: `mp4` or `webm` and the default is `webm`. If `mp4` or `webm`, `audio_sources` must have one or more tracks and/or a `video_layout` element must contain a valid `video_sources` list, otherwise an error occurs.
	Format string `json:"Format,omitempty"`
	// A descriptive string that you create to describe the resource. It can be up to  100 characters long and it must be unique within the account.
	FriendlyName string `json:"FriendlyName"`
	// A string that describes the columns (width) and rows (height) of the generated composed video in pixels. Defaults to `640x480`.  The string's format is `{width}x{height}` where:   * 16 <= `{width}` <= 1280 * 16 <= `{height}` <= 1280 * `{width}` * `{height}` <= 921,600  Typical values are:   * HD = `1280x720` * PAL = `1024x576` * VGA = `640x480` * CIF = `320x240`  Note that the `resolution` imposes an aspect ratio to the resulting composition. When the original video tracks are constrained by the aspect ratio, they are scaled to fit. See [Specifying Video Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) for more info.
	Resolution string `json:"Resolution,omitempty"`
	// The URL we should call using the `status_callback_method` to send status information to your application on every composition event. If not provided, status callback events will not be dispatched.
	StatusCallback string `json:"StatusCallback,omitempty"`
	// The HTTP method we should use to call `status_callback`. Can be: `POST` or `GET` and the default is `POST`.
	StatusCallbackMethod string `json:"StatusCallbackMethod,omitempty"`
	// Whether to clip the intervals where there is no active media in the compositions triggered by the composition hook. The default is `true`. Compositions with `trim` enabled are shorter when the Room is created and no Participant joins for a while as well as if all the Participants leave the room and join later, because those gaps will be removed. See [Specifying Video Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) for more info.
	Trim bool `json:"Trim,omitempty"`
	// A JSON object that describes the video layout of the composition hook in terms of regions. See [Specifying Video Layouts](https://www.twilio.com/docs/video/api/compositions-resource#specifying-video-layouts) for more info.
	VideoLayout map[string]interface{} `json:"VideoLayout,omitempty"`
