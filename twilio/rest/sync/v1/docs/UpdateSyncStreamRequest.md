## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Ttl** | **int32** | How long, in seconds, before the Stream expires and is deleted (time-to-live). Can be an integer from 0 to 31,536,000 (1 year). The default value is &#x60;0&#x60;, which means the Stream does not expire. The Stream will be deleted automatically after it expires, but there can be a delay between the expiration time and the resources&#39;s deletion. | [optional]
