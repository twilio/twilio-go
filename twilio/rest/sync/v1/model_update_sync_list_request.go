	// How long, in seconds, before the Sync List expires (time-to-live) and is deleted. Can be an integer from 0 to 31,536,000 (1 year). The default value is `0`, which means the Sync List does not expire. The Sync List will be deleted automatically after it expires, but there can be a delay between the expiration time and the resources's deletion.
