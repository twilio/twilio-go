// UpdateSyncMapItemRequest struct for UpdateSyncMapItemRequest
type UpdateSyncMapItemRequest struct {
	// How long, in seconds, before the Map Item's parent Sync Map expires (time-to-live) and is deleted.  Can be an integer from 0 to 31,536,000 (1 year). The default value is `0`, which means the parent Sync Map does not expire. This parameter can only be used when the Map Item's `data` or `ttl` is updated in the same request. The Sync Map will be deleted automatically after it expires, but there can be a delay between the expiration time and the resources's deletion.
	CollectionTtl int32 `json:"CollectionTtl,omitempty"`
	// A JSON string that represents an arbitrary, schema-less object that the Map Item stores. Can be up to 16 KiB in length.
	Data map[string]interface{} `json:"Data,omitempty"`
	// How long, in seconds, before the Map Item expires (time-to-live) and is deleted.  Can be an integer from 0 to 31,536,000 (1 year).

The Map Item will be deleted automatically after it expires, but there can be a delay between the expiration time and the resources's deletion.
	ItemTtl int32 `json:"ItemTtl,omitempty"`
	// An alias for `item_ttl`. If both parameters are provided, this value is ignored.
