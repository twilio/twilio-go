	// How long, in seconds, before the Sync Map expires (time-to-live) and is deleted. Can be an integer from 0 to 31,536,000 (1 year). The default value is `0`, which means the Sync Map does not expire. The Sync Map will be deleted automatically after it expires, but there can be a delay between the expiration time and the resources's deletion.

	// An alias for `collection_ttl`. If both parameters are provided, this value is ignored.
	Ttl int32 `json:"Ttl,omitempty"`
	// An application-defined string that uniquely identifies the resource. It can be used as an alternative to the `sid` in the URL path to address the resource.
