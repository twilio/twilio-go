# CreateMessageRequest

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**AddressRetention** | **string** | Determines if the address can be stored or obfuscated based on privacy settings | [optional] 
**ApplicationSid** | **string** | The SID of the application that should receive message status. We POST a &#x60;message_sid&#x60; parameter and a &#x60;message_status&#x60; parameter with a value of &#x60;sent&#x60; or &#x60;failed&#x60; to the [application](https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/api/applications)&#39;s &#x60;message_status_callback&#x60;. If a &#x60;status_callback&#x60; parameter is also passed, it will be ignored and the application&#39;s &#x60;message_status_callback&#x60; parameter will be used. | [optional] 
**Attempt** | **int32** | Total number of attempts made ( including this ) to send out the message regardless of the provider used | [optional] 
**Body** | **string** | The text of the message you want to send. Can be up to 1,600 characters in length. | [optional] 
**ContentRetention** | **string** | Determines if the message content can be stored or redacted based on privacy settings | [optional] 
**ForceDelivery** | **bool** | Reserved | [optional] 
**From** | **string** | A Twilio phone number in [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) format, an [alphanumeric sender ID](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/send-messages#use-an-alphanumeric-sender-id), or a [Channel Endpoint address](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/channels#channel-addresses) that is enabled for the type of message you want to send. Phone numbers or [short codes](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/short-code) purchased from Twilio also work here. You cannot, for example, spoof messages from a private cell phone number. If you are using &#x60;messaging_service_sid&#x60;, this parameter must be empty. | [optional] 
**MaxPrice** | **float32** | The maximum total price in US dollars that you will pay for the message to be delivered. Can be a decimal value that has up to 4 decimal places. All messages are queued for delivery and the message cost is checked before the message is sent. If the cost exceeds &#x60;max_price&#x60;, the message will fail and a status of &#x60;Failed&#x60; is sent to the status callback. If &#x60;MaxPrice&#x60; is not set, the message cost is not checked. | [optional] 
**MediaUrl** | **[]string** | The URL of the media to send with the message. The media can be of type &#x60;gif&#x60;, &#x60;png&#x60;, and &#x60;jpeg&#x60; and will be formatted correctly on the recipient&#39;s device. The media size limit is 5MB for supported file types (JPEG, PNG, GIF) and 500KB for [other types](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/accepted-mime-types) of accepted media. To send more than one image in the message body, provide multiple &#x60;media_url&#x60; parameters in the POST request. You can include up to 10 &#x60;media_url&#x60; parameters per message. You can send images in an SMS message in only the US and Canada. | [optional] 
**MessagingServiceSid** | **string** | The SID of the [Messaging Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/services#send-a-message-with-copilot) you want to associate with the Message. Set this parameter to use the [Messaging Service Settings and Copilot Features](https://www.twilio.com/console/sms/services) you have configured and leave the &#x60;from&#x60; parameter empty. When only this parameter is set, Twilio will use your enabled Copilot Features to select the &#x60;from&#x60; phone number for delivery. | [optional] 
**PersistentAction** | **[]string** | Rich actions for Channels Messages. | [optional] 
**ProvideFeedback** | **bool** | Whether to confirm delivery of the message. Set this value to &#x60;true&#x60; if you are sending messages that have a trackable user action and you intend to confirm delivery of the message using the [Message Feedback API](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/api/message-feedback-resource). This parameter is &#x60;false&#x60; by default. | [optional] 
**SmartEncoded** | **bool** | Whether to detect Unicode characters that have a similar GSM-7 character and replace them. Can be: &#x60;true&#x60; or &#x60;false&#x60;. | [optional] 
**StatusCallback** | **string** | The URL we should call using the &#x60;status_callback_method&#x60; to send status information to your application. If specified, we POST these message status changes to the URL: &#x60;queued&#x60;, &#x60;failed&#x60;, &#x60;sent&#x60;, &#x60;delivered&#x60;, or &#x60;undelivered&#x60;. Twilio will POST its [standard request parameters](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/twiml#request-parameters) as well as some additional parameters including &#x60;MessageSid&#x60;, &#x60;MessageStatus&#x60;, and &#x60;ErrorCode&#x60;. If you include this parameter with the &#x60;messaging_service_sid&#x60;, we use this URL instead of the Status Callback URL of the [Messaging Service](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/services/api). URLs must contain a valid hostname and underscores are not allowed. | [optional] 
**To** | **string** | The destination phone number in [E.164](https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-e164) format for SMS/MMS or [Channel user address](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms/channels#channel-addresses) for other 3rd-party channels. | 
**ValidityPeriod** | **int32** | How long in seconds the message can remain in our outgoing message queue. After this period elapses, the message fails and we call your status callback. Can be between 1 and the default value of 14,400 seconds. After a message has been accepted by a carrier, however, we cannot guarantee that the message will not be queued after this period. We recommend that this value be at least 5 seconds. | [optional]
