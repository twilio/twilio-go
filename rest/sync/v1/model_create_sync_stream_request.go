type CreateSyncStreamRequest struct {
	// How long, in seconds, before the Stream expires and is deleted (time-to-live). Can be an integer from 0 to 31,536,000 (1 year). The default value is `0`, which means the Stream does not expire. The Stream will be deleted automatically after it expires, but there can be a delay between the expiration time and the resources's deletion.
	Ttl int32 `json:"Ttl,omitempty"`
	// An application-defined string that uniquely identifies the resource. This value must be unique within its Service and it can be up to 320 characters long. The `unique_name` value can be used as an alternative to the `sid` in the URL path to address the resource.
	UniqueName string `json:"UniqueName,omitempty"`
