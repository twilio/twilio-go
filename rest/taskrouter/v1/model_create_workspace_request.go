// CreateWorkspaceRequest struct for CreateWorkspaceRequest
type CreateWorkspaceRequest struct {
	// The URL we should call when an event occurs. If provided, the Workspace will publish events to this URL, for example, to collect data for reporting. See [Workspace Events](https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/api/event) for more information.
	EventCallbackUrl string `json:"EventCallbackUrl,omitempty"`
	// The list of Workspace events for which to call event_callback_url. For example if `EventsFilter=task.created,task.canceled,worker.activity.update`, then TaskRouter will call event_callback_url only when a task is created, canceled, or a Worker activity is updated.
	EventsFilter string `json:"EventsFilter,omitempty"`
	// A descriptive string that you create to describe the Workspace resource. It can be up to 64 characters long. For example: `Customer Support` or `2014 Election Campaign`.
	FriendlyName string `json:"FriendlyName"`
	// Whether to enable multi-tasking. Can be: `true` to enable multi-tasking, or `false` to disable it. The default is `false`. Multi-tasking allows Workers to handle multiple Tasks simultaneously. When enabled (`true`), each Worker can receive parallel reservations up to the per-channel maximums defined in the Workers section. Otherwise, each Worker will only receive a new reservation when the previous task is completed. Learn more at [Multitasking][https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/multitasking].
	MultiTaskEnabled bool `json:"MultiTaskEnabled,omitempty"`
	// The type of TaskQueue to prioritize when Workers are receiving Tasks from both types of TaskQueues. Can be: `LIFO` or `FIFO` and the default is `FIFO`. For more information, see [Queue Ordering][https://www.twilio.com/docs/taskrouter/queue-ordering-last-first-out-lifo].
	PrioritizeQueueOrder string `json:"PrioritizeQueueOrder,omitempty"`
	// An available template name. Can be: `NONE` or `FIFO` and the default is `NONE`. Pre-configures the Workspace with the Workflow and Activities specified in the template. `NONE` will create a Workspace with only a set of default activities. `FIFO` will configure TaskRouter with a set of default activities and a single TaskQueue for first-in, first-out distribution, which can be useful when you are getting started with TaskRouter.
	Template string `json:"Template,omitempty"`
